Each existing unread and subsequent new emails after the script is started are 
passed as Mail objects to "process_email" function.Function header is provided
but processing implementation is left to the user. Error logs are currently sent
to a rotating log file (in the same directory as the script) and to STDOUT. 
Instead of polling or checking the server for new emails every now and then,
IMAP IDLE check is utilized.  Ensure that the IMAP server supports IDLE command
and allows at least 5 minutes of idling*** and uses the default ports for this 
script to work. Tested to work with Gmail and default installations of MS 
Exchange Server.

Dependencies:  
  Python 2.5+
	eventlet

Files:
	1. imap_monitor.py - the script itself
	2. imap_monitor.ini - a sample INI file with the minimum required sections
		and settings; must be named as such ("imap_monitor.ini") and be located
		in the same directory as the script

To Do:
	1. ***Remove hard-coded IDLE timeout; place in config file
	2. Support non-standard port numbers through config file 
	3. Accept command line settings - control verbosity of logging
	4. Support SMTP log handling for CRITICAL errors
	5. Improve/expand error handling blocks
